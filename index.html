                                        <h3>Tuberculosis in Africa</h3>
                                        <p>Tuberculosis is a serious infectious disease that mainly affects the lungs. The bacteria that cause tuberculosis are transmitted from person to person through droplets that come out into the air through coughing and sneezing.

                                             Once rare in developing countries, TB infections began to increase in 1985, partly due to the emergence of HIV, the virus that causes AIDS. HIV weakens a person's immune system, as they are unable to resist germs. In the United States, due to strong control programs, TB began to decline again in 1993. But they are still a source of concern.
                                             
                                             Many strains of tuberculosis are resistant to the drugs most commonly used to treat the disease. People with active TB must take several types of medications for months, to eliminate infection and prevent increased antibiotic resistance.</p>

                         <h3>Cumulative coronavirus cases in Africa 2022, by country</h3>
                         <p>As of November 18, 2022, the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases in Africa amounted to around 12.7 million, which represented around two percent of the infections around the world. By the same date, coronavirus cases globally were over 640 million, deaths were over six million, while approximately 620 million people recovered from the disease. On the African continent, South Africa was the most drastically affected country, with more than 3.6 million infections.</p>
                         <blockquote> The African continent first came in contact with the coronavirus pandemic on February 14, 2020, in the northernmost part, particularly Egypt. Since then, the different governments took severe restrictive measures to try to curb the spread of the disease. Moreover, the official numbers of the African continent are significantly lower than those of Europe, North America, South America, and Asia. Nevertheless, the infectious disease still managed to have its effects on several countries. South Africa had the highest number of deaths. Morocco and Tunisia, the second and third most affected in Africa, recorded 16,002 and 27,824 deaths, respectively, while Egypt registered at 24,132 as of March 02, 2022.  </blockquote>
                         <p>Although the African countries still have a long way to fully combat the virus, vaccination programs have been rolled out in the majority of Africa. Also, according to a survey, public opinion in several African countries shows a high willingness to be vaccinated, with Ethiopia having numbers as high as 94 percent. As of March 2022, Egypt was the country administering the highest number of vaccine doses, however, Seychelles had the highest per rate per 100 people .</p>
